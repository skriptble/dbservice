dbservice
=========

A basic database service. This will retrieve database files stored in the same folder and serve them to a client.

Roadmap
=======
The goal for this tool is to provide a way to create live dumps of database when necessary and hold information about all databases available within the system.

This system will also be able to act as a database archiving and backup system, storing requested databases for a set amount of time.
